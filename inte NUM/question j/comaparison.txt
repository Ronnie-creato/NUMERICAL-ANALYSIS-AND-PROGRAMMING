Power Iteration Method:

It is designed to find the largest eigenvalue and its corresponding eigenvector.
It may not be able to find all eigenvalues and eigenvectors but is simple and efficient for finding the dominant eigenvalue.
QR Algorithm:

It provides all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix.
It is more computationally intensive compared to the Power Iteration method but more comprehensive.
Differences:

Eigenvalues: The largest eigenvalue obtained from the Power Iteration method should match the largest eigenvalue from the QR Algorithm.
Eigenvectors: The corresponding eigenvector from the Power Iteration method should be close to the corresponding eigenvector from the QR Algorithm, though signs or scaling may differ due to normalization differences.
